\begin{abstract}
In this report, we derive the cosmological density of primordial Lithium as a fraction of the cosmological density of Helium using statistical mechanics.
This model forms the standard Big-Bang-Nucleosynthesis model that describes the primordial abundance of elements in our universe.  We compare observational data-points on the relative abundance of Lithium in stellar atmospheres and compare that to our predicted prevalence of Lithium.  In doing so, we expose an ongoing mis-prediction in astrophysics/cosmology that results in a discrepancy in the amount of primordial Lithium present in the universe.  Specifically, we demonstrate that the theoretical values overestimate the amount of Lithium by a factor for 2-3.

\section{Background}
We start our analysis using the Friedmann equations for the thermodynamic properties of the universe.  We further assume, to the first order, a homogeneous
isotropic isentroptic universe with a high-energy fluid that can freely form neutrons, quarks, leptons and other particles if and when the universe cools down to
a temperature that allows such particles to freeze out.  If we use the Boltzmann equations to posit the equilibrium densities of various species of particles, we
can predict the relative abundance of primordial Hydrogen and Helium in our universe.  If we apply the same technique to estimate the abundance of Lithium in our
universe, we demonstrate that our predicted value is two or three time larger than the observed Lithium in the universe.  This is known as the Lithium problem
and we shall attempt to describe it in thermodynamic terms.

Standard Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN) attempts to predict the ratio of various elements and their isotopes on a cosmological scale by taking non-controversial results regarding reaction cross-sections, interaction strengths and particle species from the Standard Model and applying them to the radiation bath that enveloped the universe seconds after the big bang \cite{dodelson}.  SBBN successfully predicts the primordial abundance of \He{}, \Het{} and \Dut{} derived when compared to well observed values.  The prediction of the ratio of the abundance of primordial \He{} to primordial \Hyd{} (denoted $Y_p$) of $0.2486 \pm 0.0002$ agrees extremely well with observed values of $0.249 \pm 0.009$ \cite{pospelov}.  Despite this triumph, recent observations of \Li{} abundance seem to show a disagreement of a factor of 2-3 from the cosmological abundance that SBBN predicts (or a 4-5$\sigma$ discrepancy) \cite{fields}.

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Li{}}{\Hyd{}} &= 5.24^{+0.71}_{-0.67} \times 10^{-10}  \text{\qquad predicted from SBBN}\\
\frac{\Li{}}{\Hyd{}} &= 1.23^{+0.34}_{-0.16} \times 10^{-10}  \text{\qquad observed from Spite plateau}
\end{align*}

Confusingly, there is a separate yet related issue wherein we observe a larger than expected amount of \Li's more unstable sibling \Lis{}.  While this fragile isotope is produced through a different set of nuclear processes, these abundance observations possibly constrain or dismiss certain proposed solutions to the primary \Li{} problem.  Note that when we talk about the abundance of \Li{} in a cosmological context, we are referring to the sum total of the \Li{} and \Be{} abundance.  The majority of currently observable primordial \Li{} should be generated through the eventual decay of \Be{} to \Li{} through electron capture (unless we drastically modify the nuclear weak force).  \Be{} is primarily produced when \He{} and \Het{} fuse, thereby restricting our solution space.  Eliminating enough \Li{} from our theories without also significantly affecting the abundances of \He{} and \Het{} appears to be difficult and constitutes the core of the ``Lithium Problem''.

\subsection{Measuring Lithium Abundance}

Our current observations of \Li{} abundance come from spectral measurements of the atmospheres of metal-poor Pop II halo stars from the Milky Way.  A number of new observational techniques are being developed, including the observation of \Li{} in the atmosphere of metal-poor lower Red-Giant branch (RGB) halo stars, which put tighter constraints on the various proposed solutions to our discrepancy \cite{rgb}.  Distinguishing between \Li{} and \Lis{} is extremely difficult.  Technically, they have two different spectral lines.  Unfortunately the two spectral lines as so close that thermal broadening swamps out the difference.  A few groups have managed to tease out a few upper-bounds on \Lis{} abundance in the same metal-poor stars mentioned previously but these observations are currently a subject of ``vigorous discussion''.

\section{Pound the facts: Astrophysical solutions}

If the accuracy of the observations we have or the legitimacy of their use as a measure of primordial lithium were doubted, we could possibly explain away the entire problem as an observational artifact.  We do not have spectral lines corresponding to \ce{Li^+} ions - we can only measure neutral lithium.  This necessitates the introduction of a rather uncertain ionization correction factor which is sensitive to the temperature of the star.  Slight variations in our estimates of stellar temperature could drastically affect our lithium abundance measurements.  While the astrophysics community seems fairly confident in the validity of the lithium abundance measurements themselves, it is not clear whether the observations generalize.  Our current \Li{} abundance measurements come from low-metallicity main-sequence Pop II halo stars in the Milky Way.  It is possible that these stars actually consume \Li{} through stellar nuclear fusion.  Since lithium is heavier than hydrogen or helium, one can expect it to diffuse/sink to the stellar core, thereby reducing the observed lithium fraction in the stellar atmosphere.  Several mixing mechanisms such a turbulent mixing, convective mixing, tachocline mixing, and radiative levitation \cite{rgb} have been proposed to regulate the exact fraction of lithium that might be visible in the stellar atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the current measurements of lithium come from a wide variety of stars (from $[\ce{Fe}/\Hyd{}]$ values ranging from -3 to -1) and they all show a steady composition of \Li{} in their stellar atmospheres.  Even measurements of lower RGB stars show a similar result.  This independence of \Li{} abundance over a large range of metallicities is known as the Spite plateau.  If older main sequence stars don't burn lithium, we should expect to see more of it in the stellar atmosphere.  If said stars do burn lithium, we would expect to see an inverse correlation between the age (and metallicity) of the star and the lithium in its stellar atmosphere.  Instead, we see no trend at all.

\section{Pound the law: Nuclear physics solutions}

Instead of disputing the accuracy or generalizability of the \Li{} observations, we could attempt to propose tweaks to reaction cross-sections that aren't well determined in the lab today.  Another possible avenue is to consider new reaction chains and isotopes that may be accessible during SBBN that might allow for the consumption of lithium, producing excited nuclear states such as \ce{^{10}B^*} or \ce{^{10}C^*}.  Unfortunately, even if we propose new mechanisms for primordial or stellar consumption of lithium, we need to be careful to not upset the reaction rates for well-known reactions such as \ce{ ^{3}He(\alpha, \gamma)^{7}Be} because such reactions predict solar neutrino observations extremely well.  Therefore, existing observed elemental abundances for \He{}, \Het{} and \Dut{} limit the extent of our shenanigans.

\section{Pound the table: Cosmological solutions}

The last and most exciting avenue to solving the Lithium problem is one where we introduce new physics or tweak standard physics on cosmological scales in order to either consume the excess lithium that SBBN produces or to suppress the production of \Li{} and \Be{} in the first place.

\subsection{Dark Matter Decay}

Our current models of non-baryonic matter (independently motivated for astrophysical reasons) require us to postulate the existence of a significant amount of ``dark''-matter to fit galactic rotation curves and other anomalous phenomena.  It seems entirely feasible to postulate electromagnetic and hadronic decay paths for these dark matter candidates.  Currently, based on our strong aesthetic desire to promulgate the WIMP miracle, we model dark matter as two non-decaying weakly interacting massive particles in the 100GeV scale.  We can instead postulate the existence of dark matter particles that freeze-out (at some $ T \approx m_\chi >> m_p$) and dump energy into the thermal bath before BBN begins, thereby affecting when n-freeze-out occurs and how \Het{} is formed.  One proposed mechanism for the energy dumping is  through cascade reactions that involve splallation of \He{} using relativistic dark matter nucleons.  This tends to increase the abundance of \Het{}, \Dut{} and secondary neutrons.  Such neutrons can then destroy \Be{} through \ce{n + ^7Be -> p + ^7Li}.  So-so solutions are available but the difficulty with this approach is that any extra injection of energy before \He{} formation upsets both \He{} and \Dut{} balance which already agrees with observations extremely well.

\subsection{Charged Dark-Matter Catalysis}

We may also propose dark matter that doesn't decay through electromagnetic or hadronic means.  Dark matter could instead be charged.  Such a particle $X$ may instead act as a catalyst.  By forming a dark-matter -- nucleon system (such as \ce{^{4}He X^-}), these charged dark matter particles can reduce the coulomb barrier for various nuclear reactions.  In particular, the reaction rate for \ce{^{4}He X^- + d -> \Li{} + X^-} may be increased enough to consume a large fraction of \Li{} that SBBN might otherwise produce.	Such models might even be able to produce \Lis  at the correct level.  Unfortunately, these models suffer from the ``we're just making stuff up'' problem.   We can't measure reaction cross-sections or decay times for imaginary magical charged dark matter particles. Nevertheless, there are non-cosmological reasons to consider charged super-symmetric dark matter particles among other candidate particles and relics.  Besides, I happen to love cutesy names like gravitinos, neutralinos, squarks, gluinos and sleptons that I might just be rooting for this solution just to see respectable cosmologist say those words during a pop-sci TV interview at some point.

\subsection{Variable Constants}

A much more drastic approach is to put down the scalpel of specific particles that happen to suppress or consume \Li{} and \Be{} during BBN and instead pick up the chainsaw approach of varying the coupling constants and binding energies of various fundamental forces.  In particular, one can vary the neutron-proton mass difference $\delta m_{np}$ or the deuteron binding energy $E_d$ or even the QCD coupling constant $\Lambda_{QCD}$ to affect the reaction rates of Lithium.  If one is particularly crafty, one can propose a model that affects these running constants during the temperature scale of BBN for revert them to the values we measure (or infer) for times after BBN.  In fact a 10\% variation of the deuteron binding energy can entirely solve the lithium abundance problem.  There even might be some (controversial) measurements of the fine structure constant in stars at very high-z that might justify such adjustments.

\subsection{Divine Intervention}

One particularly amusing approach for the lithium problem actually comes from an attempt to eliminate dark energy.  A void model that postulates that we are in a region of low-density on the scale of the cosmological horizon might be able to explain accelerating expansion as an outcome of large scale perturbations \cite{void}.  But it might also be able to explain the lithium problem because our observations of \Dut{} and \He{} abundance comes from high-z galaxy systems and from the CMB but our \Li{} abundance observations come from stars that are close to the Milky Way (halo stars).  Therefore, if we happen to ``coincidentally'' be at the center of a patch of universe with a symmetric low-density perturbation on the scale of the cosmological horizon, then we would expect to see a lower \Li{} fraction locally.  Sadly these theories, while being extremely clever, suffer from the fact that they discard the Copernican principle and assume a privileged frame for Earth in the context of the universe - thereby befuddling most scientists (while possibly pleasing a Pope or so).  Furthermore, current observations on the variation of the baryon-to-matter density limits any perturbations to an 8\% variation within our galaxy \cite{holder} while any explanation for Lithium would require more than a 50\% variation in density.  Furthermore, there are issues involving dark energy that show up within most void models.  Nevertheless, such models are pretty cute and provide a rather Aristotelian model of the universe that indeed places us at a unique and privileged vantage point.

% When commands are referred to in this example file, they are always
% shown with their required arguments, using normal \TeX{} format. In
% this format, \verb+#1+, \verb+#2+, etc. stand for required
% author-supplied arguments to commands. For example, in
% \verb+\section{#1}+ the \verb+#1+ stands for the title text of the
% author's section heading, and in \verb+\title{#1}+ the \verb+#1+
% stands for the title text of the paper.

% Line breaks in section headings at all levels can be introduced using
% \textbackslash\textbackslash. A blank input line tells \TeX\ that the
% paragraph has ended. Note that top-level section headings are
% automatically uppercased. If a specific letter or word should appear in
% lowercase instead, you must escape it using \verb+\lowercase{#1}+ as
% in the word ``via'' above.

% \subsection{\label{sec:level2}Second-level heading: Formatting}

% This file may be formatted in either the \texttt{preprint} or
% \texttt{reprint} style. \texttt{reprint} format mimics final journal output. 
% Either format may be used for submission purposes. \texttt{letter} sized paper should
% be used when submitting to APS journals.

% \subsubsection{Wide text (A level-3 head)}
% The \texttt{widetext} environment will make the text the width of the
% full page, as on page~\pageref{eq:wideeq}. (Note the use the
% \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command to refer to the page number.) 
% \paragraph{Note (Fourth-level head is run in)}
% The width-changing commands only take effect in two-column formatting. 
% There is no effect if text is in a single column.

% \subsection{\label{sec:citeref}Citations and References}
% A citation in text uses the command \verb+\cite{#1}+ or
% \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+ and refers to an entry in the bibliography. 
% An entry in the bibliography is a reference to another document.

% \subsubsection{Citations}
% Because REV\TeX\ uses the \verb+natbib+ package of Patrick Daly, 
% the entire repertoire of commands in that package are available for your document;
% see the \verb+natbib+ documentation for further details. Please note that
% REV\TeX\ requires version 8.31a or later of \verb+natbib+.

% \paragraph{Syntax}
% The argument of \verb+\cite+ may be a single \emph{key}, 
% or may consist of a comma-separated list of keys.
% The citation \emph{key} may contain 
% letters, numbers, the dash (-) character, or the period (.) character. 
% New with natbib 8.3 is an extension to the syntax that allows for 
% a star (*) form and two optional arguments on the citation key itself.
% The syntax of the \verb+\cite+ command is thus (informally stated)
% \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{key} \verb+}+, or\\
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+}+, or\\
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+,+ \emph{optarg+key}\ldots \verb+}+,
% \end{quotation}\noindent
% where \emph{optarg+key} signifies 
% \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
% \emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{*}\emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or even\\
% \texttt{*}\texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}.
% \end{quotation}\noindent
% where \emph{pre} and \emph{post} is whatever text you wish to place 
% at the beginning and end, respectively, of the bibliographic reference
% (see Ref.~[\onlinecite{witten2001}] and the two under Ref.~[\onlinecite{feyn54}]).
% (Keep in mind that no automatic space or punctuation is applied.)
% It is highly recommended that you put the entire \emph{pre} or \emph{post} portion 
% within its own set of braces, for example: 
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \texttt{[} \verb+{+\emph{text}\verb+}+\texttt{]}\emph{key}\verb+}+.
% The extra set of braces will keep \LaTeX\ out of trouble if your \emph{text} contains the comma (,) character.

% The star (*) modifier to the \emph{key} signifies that the reference is to be 
% merged with the previous reference into a single bibliographic entry, 
% a common idiom in APS and AIP articles (see below, Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]). 
% When references are merged in this way, they are separated by a semicolon instead of 
% the period (full stop) that would otherwise appear.

% \paragraph{Eliding repeated information}
% When a reference is merged, some of its fields may be elided: for example, 
% when the author matches that of the previous reference, it is omitted. 
% If both author and journal match, both are omitted.
% If the journal matches, but the author does not, the journal is replaced by \emph{ibid.},
% as exemplified by Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]. 
% These rules embody common editorial practice in APS and AIP journals and will only
% be in effect if the markup features of the APS and AIP Bib\TeX\ styles is employed.

% \paragraph{The options of the cite command itself}
% Please note that optional arguments to the \emph{key} change the reference in the bibliography, 
% not the citation in the body of the document. 
% For the latter, use the optional arguments of the \verb+\cite+ command itself:
% \verb+\cite+ \texttt{*}\allowbreak
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
% \texttt{[}\emph{post-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
% \verb+{+\emph{key-list}\verb+}+.

% \subsubsection{Example citations}
% By default, citations are numerical\cite{Beutler1994}.
% Author-year citations are used when the journal is RMP. 
% To give a textual citation, use \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+: 
% Refs.~\onlinecite{[][{, and references therein}]witten2001,Bire82}. 
% By default, the \texttt{natbib} package automatically sorts your citations into numerical order and ``compresses'' runs of three or more consecutive numerical citations.
% REV\TeX\ provides the ability to automatically change the punctuation when switching between journal styles that provide citations in square brackets and those that use a superscript style instead. This is done through the \texttt{citeautoscript} option. For instance, the journal style \texttt{prb} automatically invokes this option because \textit{Physical 
% Review B} uses superscript-style citations. The effect is to move the punctuation, which normally comes after a citation in square brackets, to its proper position before the superscript. 
% To illustrate, we cite several together 
% \cite{[See the explanation of time travel in ]feyn54,*[The classical relativistic treatment of ][ is a relative classic]epr,witten2001,Berman1983,Davies1998,Bire82}, 
% and once again in different order (Refs.~\cite{epr,feyn54,Bire82,Berman1983,witten2001,Davies1998}). 
% Note that the citations were both compressed and sorted. Futhermore, running this sample file under the \texttt{prb} option will move the punctuation to the correct place.

% When the \verb+prb+ class option is used, the \verb+\cite{#1}+ command
% displays the reference's number as a superscript rather than in
% square brackets. Note that the location of the \verb+\cite{#1}+
% command should be adjusted for the reference style: the superscript
% references in \verb+prb+ style must appear after punctuation;
% otherwise the reference must appear before any punctuation. This
% sample was written for the regular (non-\texttt{prb}) citation style.
% The command \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+ in the \texttt{prb} style also
% displays the reference on the baseline.

% \subsubsection{References}
% A reference in the bibliography is specified by a \verb+\bibitem{#1}+ command
% with the same argument as the \verb+\cite{#1}+ command.
% \verb+\bibitem{#1}+ commands may be crafted by hand or, preferably,
% generated by Bib\TeX. 
% REV\TeX~4.2 includes Bib\TeX\ style files
% \verb+apsrev4-2.bst+, \verb+apsrmp4-2.bst+ appropriate for
% \textit{Physical Review} and \textit{Reviews of Modern Physics},
% respectively.

% \subsubsection{Example references}
% This sample file employs the \verb+\bibliography+ command, 
% which formats the \texttt{\jobname .bbl} file
% and specifies which bibliographic databases are to be used by Bib\TeX\ 
% (one of these should be by arXiv convention \texttt{\jobname .bib}).
% Running Bib\TeX\ (via \texttt{bibtex \jobname}) 
% after the first pass of \LaTeX\ produces the file
% \texttt{\jobname .bbl} which contains the automatically formatted
% \verb+\bibitem+ commands (including extra markup information via
% \verb+\bibinfo+ and \verb+\bibfield+ commands). 
% If not using Bib\TeX, you will have to create the \verb+thebibiliography+ environment 
% and its \verb+\bibitem+ commands by hand.

% Numerous examples of the use of the APS bibliographic entry types appear in the bibliography of this sample document.
% You can refer to the \texttt{\jobname .bib} file, 
% and compare its information to the formatted bibliography itself.

% \subsection{Footnotes}%
% Footnotes, produced using the \verb+\footnote{#1}+ command, 
% usually integrated into the bibliography alongside the other entries.
% Numerical citation styles do this%
% \footnote{Automatically placing footnotes into the bibliography requires using BibTeX to compile the bibliography.};
% author-year citation styles place the footnote at the bottom of the text column.
% Note: due to the method used to place footnotes in the bibliography, 
% \emph{you must re-run Bib\TeX\ every time you change any of your document's footnotes}. 

% \section{Math and Equations}
% Inline math may be typeset using the \verb+$+ delimiters. Bold math
% symbols may be achieved using the \verb+bm+ package and the
% \verb+\bm{#1}+ command it supplies. For instance, a bold $\alpha$ can
% be typeset as \verb+$\bm{\alpha}$+ giving $\bm{\alpha}$. Fraktur and
% Blackboard (or open face or double struck) characters should be
% typeset using the \verb+\mathfrak{#1}+ and \verb+\mathbb{#1}+ commands
% respectively. Both are supplied by the \texttt{amssymb} package. For
% example, \verb+$\mathbb{R}$+ gives $\mathbb{R}$ and
% \verb+$\mathfrak{G}$+ gives $\mathfrak{G}$

% In \LaTeX\ there are many different ways to display equations, and a
% few preferred ways are noted below. Displayed math will center by
% default. Use the class option \verb+fleqn+ to flush equations left.

% Below we have numbered single-line equations; this is the most common
% type of equation in \textit{Physical Review}:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \chi_+(p)\alt{\bf [}2|{\bf p}|(|{\bf p}|+p_z){\bf ]}^{-1/2}
% \left(
% \begin{array}{c}
% |{\bf p}|+p_z\\
% px+ip_y
% \end{array}\right)\;,
% \\
% \left\{%
%  \openone234567890abc123\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
%  \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
% \right\}%
% \label{eq:one}.
% \end{eqnarray}
% Note the open one in Eq.~(\ref{eq:one}).

% Not all numbered equations will fit within a narrow column this
% way. The equation number will move down automatically if it cannot fit
% on the same line with a one-line equation:
% \begin{equation}
% \left\{
%  ab12345678abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
%  \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
% \right\}.
% \end{equation}

% When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without
% knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just
% use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that used in
% the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

% Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset
% using the \verb+\[+, \verb+\]+ format:
% \[g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
% q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \]


% \subsection{Multiline equations}

% Multiline equations are obtained by using the \verb+eqnarray+
% environment.  Use the \verb+\nonumber+ command at the end of each line
% to avoid assigning a number:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% {\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
% \delta_{\sigma_1,-\sigma_2}
% (g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
% &&\times
% [\epsilon_jl_i\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1),
% \end{eqnarray}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
%         (N^2-1)\nonumber \\
%  & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
%   \sum_{\text{perm}}
%  \frac{1}{S_{12}}
%  \frac{1}{S_{12}}
%  \sum_\tau c^f_\tau~.
% \end{eqnarray}
% \textbf{Note:} Do not use \verb+\label{#1}+ on a line of a multiline
% equation if \verb+\nonumber+ is also used on that line. Incorrect
% cross-referencing will result. Notice the use \verb+\text{#1}+ for
% using a Roman font within a math environment.

% To set a multiline equation without \emph{any} equation
% numbers, use the \verb+\begin{eqnarray*}+,
% \verb+\end{eqnarray*}+ format:
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% \sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
%         (N^2-1)\\
%  & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
%  \left(
%   \sum_{\text{perm}}\frac{1}{S_{12}S_{23}S_{n1}}
%  \right)
%  \frac{1}{S_{12}}~.
% \end{eqnarray*}

% To obtain numbers not normally produced by the automatic numbering,
% use the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command, where \verb+#1+ is the desired
% equation number. For example, to get an equation number of
% (\ref{eq:mynum}),
% \begin{equation}
% g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
% q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \tag{2.6$'$}\label{eq:mynum}
% \end{equation}

% \paragraph{A few notes on \texttt{tag}s} 
% \verb+\tag{#1}+ requires the \texttt{amsmath} package. 
% Place the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command before the \verb+\label{#1}+, if any. 
% The numbering produced by \verb+\tag{#1}+ \textit{does not affect} 
% the automatic numbering in REV\TeX; 
% therefore, the number must be known ahead of time, 
% and it must be manually adjusted if other equations are added. 
% \verb+\tag{#1}+ works with both single-line and multiline equations. 
% \verb+\tag{#1}+ should only be used in exceptional cases---%
% do not use it to number many equations in your paper. 
% Please note that this feature of the \texttt{amsmath} package
% is \emph{not} compatible with the \texttt{hyperref} (6.77u) package.

% Enclosing display math within
% \verb+\begin{subequations}+ and \verb+\end{subequations}+ will produce
% a set of equations that are labeled with letters, as shown in
% Eqs.~(\ref{subeq:1}) and (\ref{subeq:2}) below.
% You may include any number of single-line and multiline equations,
% although it is probably not a good idea to follow one display math
% directly after another.
% \begin{subequations}
% \label{eq:whole}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% {\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
% (g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
% &&\times
% [\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1).\label{subeq:2}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \begin{equation}
% \left\{
%  abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
%  \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}
% \right\},\label{subeq:1}
% \end{equation}
% \end{subequations}
% Giving a \verb+\label{#1}+ command directly after the \verb+\begin{subequations}+, 
% allows you to reference all the equations in the \texttt{subequations} environment. 
% For example, the equations in the preceding subequations environment were
% Eqs.~(\ref{eq:whole}).

% \subsubsection{Wide equations}
% The equation that follows is set in a wide format, i.e., it spans the full page. 
% The wide format is reserved for long equations
% that cannot easily be set in a single column:
% \begin{widetext}
% \begin{equation}
% {\cal R}^{(\text{d})}=
%  g_{\sigma_2}^e
%  \left(
%   \frac{[\Gamma^Z(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
%   +\frac{[\Gamma^Z(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
%  \right)
%  + x_WQ_e
%  \left(
%   \frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
%   +\frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
%  \right)\;. 
%  \label{eq:wideeq}
% \end{equation}
% \end{widetext}
% This is typed to show how the output appears in wide format.
% (Incidentally, since there is no blank line between the \texttt{equation} environment above 
% and the start of this paragraph, this paragraph is not indented.)

% \section{Cross-referencing}
% REV\TeX{} will automatically number such things as
% sections, footnotes, equations, figure captions, and table captions. 
% In order to reference them in text, use the
% \verb+\label{#1}+ and \verb+\ref{#1}+ commands. 
% To reference a particular page, use the \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command.

% The \verb+\label{#1}+ should appear 
% within the section heading, 
% within the footnote text, 
% within the equation, or 
% within the table or figure caption. 
% The \verb+\ref{#1}+ command
% is used in text at the point where the reference is to be displayed.  
% Some examples: Section~\ref{sec:level1} on page~\pageref{sec:level1},
% Table~\ref{tab:table1},%
% \begin{table}[b]%The best place to locate the table environment is directly after its first reference in text
% \caption{\label{tab:table1}%
% A table that fits into a single column of a two-column layout. 
% Note that REV\TeX~4 adjusts the intercolumn spacing so that the table fills the

% \section{Floats: Figures, Tables, Videos, etc.}
% Figures and tables are usually allowed to ``float'', which means that their
% placement is determined by \LaTeX, while the document is being typeset. 

% Use the \texttt{figure} environment for a figure, the \texttt{table} environment for a table.
% In each case, use the \verb+\caption+ command within to give the text of the
% figure or table caption along with the \verb+\label+ command to provide
% a key for referring to this figure or table.
% The typical content of a figure is an image of some kind; 
% that of a table is an alignment.%
% %\begin{figure*}
% %\includegraphics{fig_2}% Here is how to import EPS art

% \begin{table*}
% \caption{\label{tab:table3}This is a wide table that spans the full page
% width in a two-column layout. It is formatted using the
% \texttt{table*} environment. It also demonstates the use of
% \textbackslash\texttt{multicolumn} in rows with entries that span
% more than one column.}

% Insert an image using either the \texttt{graphics} or
% \texttt{graphix} packages, which define the \verb+\includegraphics{#1}+ command.
% (The two packages differ in respect of the optional arguments 
% used to specify the orientation, scaling, and translation of the image.) 
% To create an alignment, use the \texttt{tabular} environment. 

% The best place to locate the \texttt{figure} or \texttt{table} environment
% is immediately following its first reference in text; this sample document
% illustrates this practice for Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}, which
% shows a figure that is small enough to fit in a single column. 

% In exceptional cases, you will need to move the float earlier in the document, as was done
% with Table~\ref{tab:table3}: \LaTeX's float placement algorithms need to know
% about a full-page-width float earlier. 

% Fig.~\ref{fig:wide}
% has content that is too wide for a single column,
% so the \texttt{figure*} environment has been used.%
% \begin{table}[b]
% \caption{\label{tab:table4}%
% Numbers in columns Three--Five are aligned with the ``d'' column specifier 
% (requires the \texttt{dcolumn} package). 
% Non-numeric entries (those entries without a ``.'') in a ``d'' column are aligned on the decimal point. 
% Use the ``D'' specifier for more complex layouts. }

% The content of a table is typically a \texttt{tabular} environment, 
% giving rows of type in aligned columns. 
% Column entries separated by \verb+&+'s, and 
% each row ends with \textbackslash\textbackslash. 
% The required argument for the \texttt{tabular} environment
% specifies how data are aligned in the columns. 
% For instance, entries may be centered, left-justified, right-justified, aligned on a decimal
% point. 
% Extra column-spacing may be be specified as well, 
% although REV\TeX~4 sets this spacing so that the columns fill the width of the
% table. Horizontal rules are typeset using the \verb+\hline+
% command. The doubled (or Scotch) rules that appear at the top and
% bottom of a table can be achieved enclosing the \texttt{tabular}
% environment within a \texttt{ruledtabular} environment. Rows whose
% columns span multiple columns can be typeset using the
% \verb+\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}+ command (for example, see the first
% row of Table~\ref{tab:table3}).%

% show various effects.
% A table that fits in a single column employs the \texttt{table}
% environment. 
% Table~\ref{tab:table3} is a wide table, set with the \texttt{table*} environment. 
% Long tables may need to break across pages. 
% The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to specify
% the \verb+[H]+ float placement on the \texttt{table} or
% \texttt{table*} environment. 
% However, the \LaTeXe\ package \texttt{longtable} allows headers and footers to be specified for each page of the table. 
% A simple example of the use of \texttt{longtable} can be found
% in the file \texttt{summary.tex} that is included with the REV\TeX~4
% distribution.

% There are two methods for setting footnotes within a table (these
% footnotes will be displayed directly below the table rather than at
% the bottom of the page or in the bibliography). The easiest
% and preferred method is just to use the \verb+\footnote{#1}+
% command. This will automatically enumerate the footnotes with
% lowercase roman letters. However, it is sometimes necessary to have
% multiple entries in the table share the same footnote. In this case,
% there is no choice but to manually create the footnotes using
% \verb+\footnotemark[#1]+ and \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+.
% \texttt{\#1} is a numeric value. Each time the same value for
% \texttt{\#1} is used, the same mark is produced in the table. The
% \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+ commands are placed after the \texttt{tabular}
% environment. Examine the \LaTeX\ source and output for
% Tables~\ref{tab:table1} and \ref{tab:table2}
% for examples.

% Video~\ref{vid:PRSTPER.4.010101} 
% illustrates several features new with REV\TeX4.2,
% starting with the \texttt{video} environment, which is in the same category with
% \texttt{figure} and \texttt{table}.%
% \begin{video}
% \href{http://prst-per.aps.org/multimedia/PRSTPER/v4/i1/e010101/e010101_vid1a.mpg}{\includegraphics{vid_1a}}%

%   Students explain their initial idea about Newton's third law to a teaching assistant. 
%   Clip (a): same force.
%   Clip (b): move backwards.
%  }%
% \end{video}
% The \verb+\setfloatlink+ command causes the title of the video to be a hyperlink to the
% indicated URL; it may be used with any environment that takes the \verb+\caption+
% command.
% The \verb+\href+ command has the same significance as it does in the context of
% the \texttt{hyperref} package: the second argument is a piece of text to be 
% typeset in your document; the first is its hyperlink, a URL.

% \textit{Physical Review} style requires that the initial citation of
% figures or tables be in numerical order in text, so don't cite
% Fig.~\ref{fig:wide} until Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart} has been cited.

% \appendix

% \section{Appendixes}

% To start the appendixes, use the \verb+\appendix+ command.
% This signals that all following section commands refer to appendixes
% instead of regular sections. Therefore, the \verb+\appendix+ command
% should be used only once---to setup the section commands to act as
% appendixes. Thereafter normal section commands are used. The heading
% for a section can be left empty. For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
% \appendix
% \section{}
% \end{verbatim}
% will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A'' and
% \begin{verbatim}
% \appendix
% \section{Background}
% \end{verbatim}
% will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A: BACKGROUND''
% (note that the colon is set automatically).

% If there is only one appendix, then the letter ``A'' should not
% appear. This is suppressed by using the star version of the appendix
% command (\verb+\appendix*+ in the place of \verb+\appendix+).

% \section{A little more on appendixes}

% Observe that this appendix was started by using
% \begin{verbatim}
% \section{A little more on appendixes}
% \end{verbatim}

% Note the equation number in an appendix:
% \begin{equation}
% E=mc^2.
% \end{equation}

% \subsection{\label{app:subsec}A subsection in an appendix}

% You can use a subsection or subsubsection in an appendix. Note the
% numbering: we are now in Appendix~\ref{app:subsec}.

% Note the equation numbers in this appendix, produced with the
% subequations environment:
% \begin{subequations}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% E&=&mc, \label{appa}
% \\
% E&=&mc^2, \label{appb}
% \\
% E&\agt& mc^3. \label{appc}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \end{subequations}
% They turn out to be Eqs.~(\ref{appa}), (\ref{appb}), and (\ref{appc}).
